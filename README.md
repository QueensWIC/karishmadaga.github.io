# Karishma Daga

Hi there! I'm Karishma, a sophomore studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Queen's University, Canada. 

I'll be in Redmond this summer as a [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca) Explorer intern on the Core Experience Engineering team! I solo-travelled Amsterdam and Berlin as well! :) 

*Currently*, I am an electrical team member of the [Queen's Space Engineering](http://qset.ca/) design team, on the speakers team for [Starcon 2019](https://starcon.io/) (!!), and the Vice Chair of Professional Developement for [Women in CS](http://qscwisc.weebly.com/) at Queen's ðŸ’–. Ping me if you would be interested in running a workshop, mentoring students, or partnering with us.

*Recently*, I was a software developer intern @[BMO Capital Markets](https://www.bmocm.com/) (Summer 2017) where I worked on internal data validation tools for ETL layers. I was also @[MakeHarvard](http://makeharvard.io/) learning about hardware and working with VR and @[Starcon 2018](https://starcon.io/) learning about chatbots, rustlang, and more! 

I also love playing the tuba, stats, [listening to podcasts](podcast.md), solo-travelling, attending math colloquia, and going on coffee crawls. 

You can ping me at [karishma.daga@queensu.ca](mailto:karishma.daga@queensu.ca) or peep my
