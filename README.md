Hi there! I'm Karishma, a sophomore CS and Math student at Queen's University, Canada. I'm an incoming Summer 2018 [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca) Explorer intern and a previous SDE intern at [BMO Capital Markets](https://www.bmocm.com/) where I worked on internal data validation tools for ETL layers. I am an electrical team member of the [Queen's Space Engineering](http://qset.ca/) design team and the Outreach coordinator for [Women in CS](http://qscwisc.weebly.com/) at Queen's ðŸ’–. I also love playing the tuba, stats, solo-travelling, and going on coffee crawls.
