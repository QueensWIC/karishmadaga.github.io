# Karishma Daga

Hi there! I'm Karishma, a rising junior studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Queen's University, Canada. 

*Currently, I am*
- In Redmond as a [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) Explorer intern on the Core Platform Engineering team where I'm improving customer experience with NLP and chatbots!
- On the Speakers team @[StarCon 2019](https://starcon.io/)
- Vice Chair of Professional Developement for WiCS @Queen's 💖 where I run sponsorship, the mentorship program, and technical workshops
- On the lookout for Summer 2019 👀. I'm interested in EdTech, challenging projects with a lot of ownership, mentoring, and a heavy dash of statistics/math. 

*Recently, I was*
- A SDE intern @[BMO Capital Markets](https://www.bmocm.com/) (Summer 2017)
- @[MakeHarvard](http://makeharvard.io/) learning about hardware and working with VR 😎
- @[Starcon 2018](https://starcon.io/) learning about chatbots, rustlang, and more! 

I also love playing the tuba, statistics, [listening to podcasts](podcast.md), graph theory, trader joe's, solo-travelling, and going on coffee crawls.
